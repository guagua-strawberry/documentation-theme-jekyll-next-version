# Leverage Fiori widgets under ONE UX vision.
SAP Fiori 3.0+ is the user experience (UX) paradigm for SAP SME software and applications.
All product areas committed to work towards the adoption of SAP Fiori 3 as the design system that would integrate the experience of all SAP products. This decision was operationalized in a newly established product standard for UX consistency. 
As well as a new Quartz theme, SAP Fiori 3 introduced a number of new features that facilitate the integration of all SAP products to provide one coherent and consistent user experience.
SME Products have their historical UX paradigm and an existing customer.
Fiori3+ defines the UX-bridge between existing SAP SME UX Concepts and functions and the SAP Fiori 3 UX Concepts and functions.

# Keep the current BYD information structure with role-based supportive task flow.
By understanding different user need and business process, the product 
should come up with personalized solution to simplify their workflow and increase their productivity. 

# Provide feedback flow within user interaction.
As stated in Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principle for interaction design, "Visibility of system status: The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time."

Our product should provide noticeable feedback to build trust within every user interaction: when user know about the current system status, they can predict the outcome of their prior interactions and determine their next move. Predictable interaction can create trust in the product as well as the brand.

# A consistent, aesthetic, straightforward interface. 
Consistent – Consistent interface makes product intuitive and understandable. It reduces customer confusion when completing goals. 
 
Aesthetic – Well-crafted product is essential to increase user's joy of use. Good looking products and user interfaces are perceived as more valuable and easier to use than the ugly ones.
 
Straightforward – Self-explanatory product can help user learn to use our product better.
 
The combination of all these three important traits can make sure the product delivered meet our product standard and customer satisfaction.
